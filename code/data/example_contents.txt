The lightest of the colors.

Where are you from?
The United States.

Again, the sky.
The darkest of the colors.
You sponsered this survey?
No, I'm just participating in it.

Not the brightest, but not the darkest.
Between purple and pink, on the brighter side.
This one's tough...
The deeper purple.
Color closest to sand on the beach.
The color of a withering palm three branch.
Another tough one...
The color that is not the brightest or the darkest.
The color of grass.
lol, again the color of grass
Let's make it three in a row...
The one that seems bland or toned-down.
The paler of the two with similar colors.
The toned-down version of the similar colors.
The pattern repeats...
Not of the similar colors.
The brightest of them all.
The color that isn't bright.
The darker of the similar colors.
Red and blue make this one.
The one that is different.
The brightest of the three.
The color of the sky again.
The one that is not the same color as the others.
The one that isn't bright.
The darkest of them all.
The darker of the similar colors.
The paler of the similar colors.
The toned-down version of the similar colors.
The brightest of the colors.
The darkest of them all.
The brightest of them all.
My favorite color and also 'the Florida ___________.'
Think fruit.
The color that be made from red and blue.
The palest of them all.
The brightest of them all.
The brighter of the similar colors.
Think bright!
More like the color of sand.
Grass' color.
The darkest of the three.
The palest of the three.
The one that seems to clash the most.
The brightest of the three.
Again, the brightest.
The one that isn't the same.

hello, the target is similar to another color, but is not quite as bright
this is similar to the color of the Vikings or Lakers jerseys
the target is similar to the color of the ocean
the target is a darker version of the Lakers or Vikings jerseys
the target is the more subdued of the 3
the target is very slightly brighter than the similar color
the target is typically thought of as a 'female' color, sorry for being sexist
the target is similar to the color of dirt
the target is similar to Mary Kay cadillacs
the target is the color of LA Dodgers or Chicago Cubs uniforms
target is more subdued of the 3, similar to the color of leaves
target is the brightest of the 3, not similar to flesh tone
again similar to the Lakers or Vikings jerseys
the color of rouge (women's makeup)
sort of like a pumpkin
the color of leaves
somewhat like sand
like the pumpkin color only a bit lighter
again similar to leaves
darker color like the Lakers or Vikings jerseys
again similar to leaves
most subdued of the 3
not bright and not like leaves
bright but not like leaves nor like Dodgers or Cubs jerseys
more like a cloudy sky
Lakers/Vikings jerseys
middle brightness of the 3, sort of like a clear sky
the color of sand
one of the 2 very similar but slightly brighter
sort of like Vikings jerseys again but lighter
kind of ocean color but not the brightest; has a touch of leaf color
very bright 'feminine' color (again, sorry)
bright color of leaves
duller of the 2 similar colors
similar to the last choice, almost neon leaf color
looks like a Dodgers or Cubs jersey that's faded from the laundry
like a cloudy sky
very bright 'feminine' color
not very close but like a rose
looks like a very very faded Lakers or Vikings jersey
color of summer leaves but bright
same color but much brighter
same general color but much duller
bright 'feminine' color
very similar but a touch of rose color
sort of like a cloudy sky
sort of glow in the dark neon color
like very faded Lakers jerseys again
the duller of the 2 similar colors
