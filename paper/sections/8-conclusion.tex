\section{Conclusion}

Grounded understanding presumes common world and contextual understanding of a given topic. To understand the impact of this contextual information on NLU systems we enhanced the model presented in \citep{monroe-2017-colors} with color representations encoded within convolutional neural networks such as ResNet and text descriptions represented as contextual word embeddings extracted from pretrained transformers like Electra or XLNet. We conducted a series of 80 experiments using different model setups and finetuned those models along a defined hyperparameter space.

\par
We showed that more complex color and text representations donâ€™t necessarily perform better on the colors dataset. We find that these higher dimensional representations inject unnecessary noise to the system which leads to worse overall performance, given the low complexity of the descriptions in the color dataset.
